# Gradient_Graphing
A program to display the gradient - f'(x) of any given function f(x).
The program uses the approximation of δy/δx ≈ dy/dx (delta-y/delta-x is approximately dy/dx).
For small values of δx, δy/δx can be very accurate when compared to the actual gradient given by dy/dx.
As calculating dy/dx symbolically, using various methods of calculus can be very slow and much too complicated, the δy/δx method gives a slightly less accurate answer very quickly.
