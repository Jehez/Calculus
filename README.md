This set of programs is dedicated to computational calculus.
As the names suggest, the programs use brute force to compute the answer. The programs will not give precise answers as they can be irrational. However, the margin of error is negligible is most cases. The error can be reduced by increasing precision. However, this will also increase the time taken and hardware required.
These programs are designed to be used in cases where symbolic methods are not explicitly needed and only a numerical answer will do.
Each program file includes the time complexity and explanation of the methods used.

Note: The programs were initially in Python but due to speed/time constraints, were rewritten in C++ instead.
